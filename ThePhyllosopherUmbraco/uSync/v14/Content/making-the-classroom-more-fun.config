Building a safe classroom environment does not mean prioritising diverse students at the exclusion of all others. On the contrary, incorporating \\u003Ca rel=\\u0022noopener noreferrer\\u0022 href=\\u0022https://www.inclusionhub.com/articles/what-is-dei\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 class=\\u0022rJEfu fP51A\\u0022 data-hook=\\u0022WebLink\\u0022\\u003E\\u003Cu\\u003Ediversity, equity and inclusion\\u003C/u\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E (DEI) practices allows all students to express themselves as they choose. This not only makes lab sessions more enjoyable for my students, but also for myself as their teaching assistant (TA). \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv data-breakout=\\u0022normal\\u0022\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv id=\\u0022viewer-uck4i548645\\u0022 class=\\u0022SFG-K RJWgX soCUY E8vnw\\u0022 dir=\\u0022auto\\u0022\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv data-breakout=\\u0022normal\\u0022\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\u0022viewer-6odg63873\\u0022 dir=\\u0022auto\\u0022 class=\\u0022SFG-K RJWgX soCUY E8vnw\\u0022\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EPart of what I find affirming about a safe teaching environment is when students begin to open up over the semester. This is particularly evident among queer and trans students. Now this isn\\u0027t to say that queer and trans students aren\\u0027t initially open (some are), but I do think that walking into a new classroom for them will always raise considerations about how they might expect to be treated by their instructor, their peers, or how they experience the teaching material itself. Non-queer and cis students typically have the privilege of feeling more relaxed and open in a classroom environment where feelings of safety and comfort may not be a major priority. The same applies to persons of colour or students with disabilities. If we focus on building safe environments that look out for and benefit student minorities, then we build classrooms that benefit everyone. If you don\\u0027t believe me then follow along as I share some of the ways that I prioritise diversity, inclusivity and equity in my lab sessions. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv data-breakout=\\u0022normal\\u0022\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv id=\\u0022viewer-y4z734326\\u0022 class=\\u0022SFG-K RJWgX soCUY E8vnw\\u0022 dir=\\u0022auto\\u0022\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv data-breakout=\\u0022normal\\u0022\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\u0022viewer-21u77329354\\u0022 dir=\\u0022auto\\u0022 class=\\u0022SFG-K RJWgX soCUY E8vnw\\u0022\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003ESomething that I work hard at is to give my students opportunities to share about themselves as much as I can. This often saves me from making assumptions about their gender identity, ethnic/cultural identities, or abilities. A great icebreaker that I like to use during class introductions is for each student to share their current favourite song. I then make a playlist that I play during lab hour. For one thing, it helps to manage the oversaturation of \\u0027share a fun fact about yourself\\u0027 during the first week of classes and secondly, I feel that I learn a lot about each student based on their song selection. It also gives them an opportunity to discuss their music taste with me, which I feel is a great way to establish common ground with folks, regardless of the ways they identify.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv data-breakout=\\u0022normal\\u0022\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv id=\\u0022viewer-5s58f465\\u0022 class=\\u0022SFG-K RJWgX soCUY E8vnw\\u0022 dir=\\u0022auto\\u0022\\u003E\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv data-breakout=\\u0022normal\\u0022\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\u0022viewer-orzir474\\u0022 dir=\\u0022auto\\u0022 class=\\u0022SFG-K RJWgX soCUY E8vnw\\u0022\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EAllowing students to share who they are is a continual process that I involve them in either through strategic bonus questions during quiz time or outside lecture as we interact. I am constantly learning how to make this sharing process more inclusive. For example, I often rely on pop culture or TikTok trends to make up fun, relatable, bonus questions for the students, and to seem hip (but I\\u0027m probably not fooling anyone). One of my first bonus questions was: \\u0022Who is the current \\u0027\\u003Ca rel=\\u0022noopener noreferrer\\u0022 href=\\u0022https://www.teenvogue.com/story/twitter-white-boy-of-the-month-meme#:~:text=At%20its%20core%2C%20Twitter%E2%80%99s%20white%20boy%20of%20the%20month%20represents%20the%20ebbs%20and%20flows%20of%20celebrity%20on%20the%20internet.%20The%20epithet%20reduces%20these%20young%20men%20to%20their%20alluring%20attributes%20while%20consciously%20parodying%20the%20fact%20that%20we%20go%20gaga%20over%20them\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 class=\\u0022rJEfu fP51A\\u0022 data-hook=\\u0022WebLink\\u0022\\u003E\\u003Cu\\u003Ewhite boy of the month\\u003C/u\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u0027? Our multiple-choice options included, Jacob Elordi, Timoth\\u00E9e Chalamet, Paul Mescal, and Jeremy-Allen White. For student convenience and viewership satisfaction, I accompanied this question with a slide deck featuring the choices. Polling for this question was equal parts learning student preferences and their interest in following prevailing trends. It was a fun exercise, but it did exclude certain students, as was pointed out when one told me that they aren\\u0027t attracted to anyone and thus didn\\u0027t have an informed opinion on the question. For the following week I instead asked that each student share an \\u0027underrated travel destination\\u0027 with me. Instead of selecting one of only four choices, students had the freedom to share as much as they wanted with me in a short answer. This increased the level of interaction between me and the students and was honestly more rewarding. Students told me about memorable family trips, countries related to their family heritage, and future travel plans that they had. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\u0022,\u0022blocks\u0022:{\u0022contentData\u0022:[],\u0022settingsData\u0022:[],\u0022Layout\u0022:{}}}"
