This plant is the sole biological source for the active anti-malarial drug qing hao su (ching-how-soo), or, artemisinin, as it is known outside of China. At times, limitations to the availability and accessibility of this drug threatens the prevention and treatment of malaria. One of these limitations is that\\u0026nbsp;A. annua\\u0026nbsp;does not produce artemisinin in high or uniform quantities. Thus, research on metabolic engineering, like the kind done in my lab (\\u003Ca rel=\\u0022noreferrer noopener\\u0022 href=\\u0022https://cals.ncsu.edu/plant-and-microbial-biology/people/dxie/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 class=\\u0022wixui-rich-text__text\\u0022\\u003EDeyu Xie, North Carolina State University)\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003Ca rel=\\u0022noreferrer noopener\\u0022 href=\\u0022https://cals.ncsu.edu/plant-and-microbial-biology/people/dxie/\\u0022 target=\\u0022_blank\\u0022 class=\\u0022wixui-rich-text__text\\u0022\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;is important for establishing plant cultivars capable of producing high levels of artemisinin.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\u0022font_8 wixui-rich-text__text\\u0022\\u003E\\u003Ca class=\\u0022wixui-rich-text__text\\u0022\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\u0022wixui-rich-text__text\\u0022\\u003EMy work specifically focuses on a suite of enzymes that are well-known across the animal, plant and fungal kingdoms. These enzymes are important for the synthesis of many significant molecules, including artemisinin. The specific enzymes that I study are Cytochrome P450 71AV1 (CYP71AV1) and its enzymatic partners from the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway. The interactions between these enzymes \\u003C/span\\u003Eare\\u003Cspan class=\\u0022wixui-rich-text__text\\u0022\\u003E\\u0026nbsp;critical because they catalyze several steps along the biosynthetic pathway to produce a series of oxygenated molecules. Previous research has identified Cytochrome P450 Reductase (CPR1) as a functional partner of CYP71AV1. Other work proposes that Cytochrome b5 (CYB5) is another interacting partner based on its presence in the plant genome and the fact that CYB5 enzymes from different biological systems associate with CYPs. In addition to these enzymes, another CPR enzyme has been identified as a possible interacting partner of CYP71AV1 based on gene sequence homology to CPR1. This enzyme is classified as CPR2. I intend to uncover the true nature of CPR2\\u0027s functionality, including whether it interacts with CYP71AV1 to make artemisinin.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/a\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp class=\\u0022font_8 wixui-rich-text__text\\u0022\\u003E\\u003Cspan class=\\u0022wixui-rich-text__text\\u0022\\u003EThe primary mechanism behind these enzyme interactions is an electron transfer from one enzyme to the next. Electron transfers can introduce bottlenecks into a biosynthetic pathway, especially if they are inefficient (enzymes do not partner effectively, or electrons are consumed by other co-factors/enzymes). Thus, uncovering the intricacies of enzyme partnerships such as that between CYP71AV1 and CPRs/CYB5 will be invaluable to the advancement of metabolic engineering. My research intends to interrogate the specificities of the partnership between CYP71AV1 and its redox enzymes to generate important kinetic and thermodynamic data that will inform metabolic engineering strategies.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\u0022,\u0022blocks\u0022:{\u0022contentData\u0022:[],\u0022settingsData\u0022:[],\u0022Layout\u0022:{}}}",
