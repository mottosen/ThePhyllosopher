This refers to bearded 18th century thinkers who speculated about the world\\u0027s cultures atop velvet cushions while reading tales from travelers as they poured milk in their tea.\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp dir=\\u0022auto\\u0022 class=\\u0022SFG-K RJWgX soCUY E8vnw\\u0022\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EI too found myself atop a cushioned chair this past week, sadly, without armrests, at the Phytochemistry Conference in Lansing Michigan. As I listened to traveler tales about developing better tasting chickpeas and the discovery of enzymes that make medicinal plant molecules, I took on my own brand of \\u0022armchair anthropology [sans arm].\\u0022 I did my best to be a good scientist and take notes on the presentations and lectures, but at the same time I found myself taking notes at all the times in-between; paying attention to who was moderating the panel discussion effectively, who was asking questions and what kinds of questions were being asked. I thought such undertakings were worthy of a \\u0022conference chair anthropologist\\u0022. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\u0022,\u0022blocks\u0022:{\u0022contentData\u0022:[],\u0022settingsData\u0022:[],\u0022Layout\u0022:{}}}"

Our session keynote speaker was an Indigenous (First Nations) scientist from Canada. She shared her science with us, but she also shared her story--the struggles and joys of science and life and the essentiality of strong mentorship. This talk, and the talks that followed it inspired two observations--two charges to my readers if you will. The first, is to get a better sense of scientific storytelling. And the second, is to get better at responding to our storytellers. \\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv data-breakout=\\u0022normal\\u0022\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\u0022viewer-1e9fb\\u0022 dir=\\u0022auto\\u0022 class=\\u0022SFG-K RJWgX soCUY E8vnw\\u0022\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EAs scientists we are often told to present our research as a \\u0027story\\u0027, but I think we struggle to get it right. Our keynote speaker got it right. Science is all around people. We do science, but we also are science. Including ourselves within the fabric of a scientific narrative should be a given. If you do not do this, if you feel like science is not the space to share about who you are and why it matters to your research, then attend a session like this one. Look for other scientific storytellers that inspire you and recognise how important this truly is.\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv data-breakout=\\u0022normal\\u0022\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\u0022viewer-fj7o\\u0022 dir=\\u0022auto\\u0022 class=\\u0022SFG-K RJWgX soCUY E8vnw\\u0022\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003ETo my second point, I ask that we interrogate how we ask questions, and of whom, and for what purpose. There were three speakers for this session: the Indigenous keynote, a white male professor and a young white female graduate student. I share the demographics of this session because I feel that it may have unconsciously informed the kinds of questions that were asked. To our Indigenous speaker, while it is true that she was very vocal about her Indigeneity and what it takes to collaborate with Indigenous groups, the question she was asked was, \\u0022what can I do [personally] to connect with Indigenous groups\\u0022. The following speaker shared his own experiences as a non-Indigenous person connecting with Indigenous communities through his research and the question he was asked was, \\u0022have you thought to test the metabolic profile of these berries across time?\\u0022\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv data-breakout=\\u0022normal\\u0022\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\u0022viewer-8toe8\\u0022 dir=\\u0022auto\\u0022 class=\\u0022SFG-K RJWgX soCUY E8vnw\\u0022\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EBoth scientists, both talking about very similar topics, and yet one was asked a question based on their identity and the other was asked a question based on their research.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\\n\\u003Cdiv data-breakout=\\u0022normal\\u0022\\u003E\\n\\u003Cp id=\\u0022viewer-vm65\\u0022 dir=\\u0022auto\\u0022 class=\\u0022SFG-K RJWgX soCUY E8vnw\\u0022\\u003E\\u003Cspan\\u003EI recognise that there are nuances to both of these speakers and their talks. I acknowledge the temptation to defer to an Indigenous scientist on the grounds of forming meaningful connections with Indigenous communities, but I do not think it is a good question. All the other questions asked throughout this conference were incredibly specific: \\u0022have you considered other indicators of stress apart from plant volatiles?\\u0022, \\u0022how stable is your substrate intermediate?\\u0022 ... etc. In comparison, this Indigenous connections question feels incredibly vague and unforthcoming. It failed to contextualize the specificities of the speaker\\u0027s personal connections to Indigeneity and the particular communities she served. It failed to uncover the depth of knowledge that the speaker had regarding her own niche branch of science. I know that this question was well-intentioned, but I draw this to your attention because I know we can do better. We can ask better questions. If you want to honour someone\\u0027s identity because you believe it is important to how they do science, then ask a question that addresses both of these things. When we have Indigenous speakers and scientists of colour, giving them the floor is not enough. Craft your questions with care and sincerity. Let\\u0027s keep having sessions like this, but let\\u0027s give them range. Amplify the platform, question the sanctity of Western science, and if you can\\u0027t do that then for heaven\\u0027s sake, just ask them what\\u0027s going on with the metabolic profiles of their plants.\\u0026nbsp;\\u003C/span\\u003E\\u003C/p\\u003E\\n\\u003C/div\\u003E\u0022,\u0022blocks\u0022:{\u0022contentData\u0022:[],\u0022settingsData\u0022:[],\u0022Layout\u0022:{}}}"
